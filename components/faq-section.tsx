    question: "What is EaseMed and who is it for?",
    answer:
      "EaseMed is an AI-powered platform designed for healthcare organizations including hospitals, GPOs, distributors, wholesalers, and importers to automate 80% of procurement workload and optimize supply chain operations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from a generic procurement tool?",
    answer:
      "Unlike generic tools, our AI is \"healthcare-native.\" It has a deep understanding of healthcare regulations, compliance requirements, and supply chain complexities specific to hospitals, GPOs, and pharmaceutical organizations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the RFQ process protect my commercial interests?",
    answer:
      "Our RFQ Agent sends quote requests to your suppliers blindly. This means suppliers only see a request from the EaseMed platform, not from your company, preventing them from seeing who else you are approaching.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my compliance data secure?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We use a high-security, encrypted \"vault\" for all sensitive compliance documents to ensure your data is safe and your supply chain remains fully auditable.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the process for building a custom solution?",
    answer:
      "We work with you as a technology partner to develop custom S2P (Source to Pay) solutions. We start with our core platform and build custom modules to automate 80% of your procurement workload. Contact our sales team to discuss a timeline for your $10M+ project.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI handle pharmaceutical regulations?",
    answer:
      "Our AI is specifically trained for healthcare procurement, understanding regulatory compliance, supply chain traceability, and operational requirements. It automates compliance checks, inventory management, and procurement workflows in real-time.",
